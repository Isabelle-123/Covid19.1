# Covid19 data from api with a backend

An application that visualizes corona data using the covid tracking data API https://covidtracking.com/api. It shows currently hosptalized and deaths for the 3 previous days (not todays data since the data is not online until 4 ET).

Demands on the app:

- Frontend should be built using React.
- Frontend should use Material UI framework
- Visualization should be either a table or a map+hover text showing the amount of currently hospitalized corona patients per US state.
- For each state, there should also be info showing "Total new corona deaths during the last 3 days". This needs to be calculated on the backend of the application.
- Backend should be built in Node.js+Express
- In the backend you should calculate the "Total new corona deaths during the last 3 days"
